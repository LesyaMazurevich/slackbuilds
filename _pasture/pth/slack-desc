pth: pth (GNU Portable Threads)
pth:
pth: Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms
pth: which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple
pth: threads of execution (aka `multithreading') inside event-driven
pth: applications.  All threads run in the same address space of the
pth: server application, but each thread has its own individual
pth: program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.
