# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

esound-compat32: esound-compat32 (Enlightened Sound Daemon)
esound-compat32:
esound-compat32: EsounD, the Enlightened Sound Daemon, is a server process that mixes
esound-compat32: several audio streams for playback by a single audio device. For
esound-compat32: example, if you're listening to music on a CD and you receive a
esound-compat32: sound-related event from ICQ, the two applications won't have to
esound-compat32: jockey for the use of your sound card.  Install esound if you'd like
esound-compat32: to let sound applications share your audio device.
